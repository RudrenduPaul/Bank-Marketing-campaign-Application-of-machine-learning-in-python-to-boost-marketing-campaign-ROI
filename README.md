Analytics based marketing campaign for improving ROI

This is a real data set from the marketing campaign of a bank with over 40000+ people on the list

Data source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

Average response rate of people on list is 11% and hence, marketing to each person on the list incurs a loss of $ 34,000 with a ROI of negative 44 %

This machine learning model identifies the top customer segments with high probability of conversion of around 40% (4X the average) and provides a positive ROI of 150 % on a targetted list of people.
